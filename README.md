POSTFLY Business card creator is a site where it is possible to design your own business cards. The focus with this site is to combine knowledge about what it takes to design a business card with what was learned this far about HTML, CSS and JavaScript. The siteâ€™s goal is to design your own business card which you can download and request a quotation for.

User Experience (UX)
======
This is meant to be a B2B site which targets visitors  who are in need of business cards and want to design it themselves.

**User stories**

##### Visitor Goals
* Create / design your own business card.
* Be able to choose the paper type and quantity.
* Request a sample kit with papers for if you are not familiar with the paper types.
* Request quotation and download the designed cards.

##### Site Owners Goals
* Provide the service of designing your own business cards in an easy way, without additional designing costs.
* Reduce workload on the prepress (design) staff.
* Expand customer base.

**Strategy**

The design goal is to make a clear, accessible, structured site so that visitors can easily design their own business cards.

**Scope**

The site shows a homepage with an explanation, there the user can either first request a sample kit for the paper types or start designing. On the creator site it allows the user to choose out of three different sizes of business cards, to upload an own photo or logo, to choose a background color, to edit text content, to download the designed card as a pdf file, to choose the paper type, to choose the quantity, to send a request for a quotation for the designed business cards. 

**Structure**

This site is structured as clear as possible, it is easy to see what can be done on the page, on all screen sizes it is clear shouls be done on each part of the site. The design of the card is visible on all screen sizes. This all ensures that the user knows what to do and what to expect.

**Surface**

The colors that were used are the existing corporate identity colors, white and an off-white color, which are:

<img src="assets/images/readme_images/red.png" alt="Red" width="25%" height="25%"> <img src="assets/images/readme_images/dark_grey.png" alt="Dark Grey"  width="25%" height="25%"> <img src="assets/images/readme_images/white.png" alt="White"  width="25%" height="25%"> <img src="assets/images/readme_images/off_white.png" alt="Off White"  width="25%" height="25%">


During development the site's layout was restructured a little bit, because this seemed visually or otherwise better.
What was changed is:

1. The color for the red headers and buttons were changed from #E73B3B to #e72f4c and #e02a51 because during testing #E73B3B did not give a good enough contrast.
2. The icon for the website was added, because it would be logical to reffer to the main website of the company.
3. On the sample kit request form a checkbox was added to reduce spam by checking if the user is a robot.
4. The layout for desktop view on the creator.html for the card selectors was changed a bit to make it look more appealing on smaller screens and to make it more logical to follow the steps.
5. The "Select Size" and "Select Printing Method" options were combined to give it a UX friendly experience.


**Fonts & icons**

[Google Fonts](https://fonts.google.com/) was used to embed the Roboto font in the code. Roboto was choosen because this is already in use on the existing POSTFLY site.

For the icons on the homepage [Font Awesome](https://fontawesome.com/) was used and for the creator page the icons of [Materialize](https://materializecss.com/icons.html) were used.
