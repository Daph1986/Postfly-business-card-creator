User Experience (UX)
======
This is meant to be a B2B site which targets visitors  who are in need of business cards and want to design it themselves.

**User stories**

##### Visitor Goals
* Create / design your own business card.
* Be able to choose the paper type and quantity.
* Request quotation and download the designed cards.

##### Site Owners Goals
* Provide the service of designing your own business cards in an easy way, without additional designing costs.
* Reduce workload on the prepress (design) staff.
* Expand customer base.

**Strategy**

The design goal is to make a clear, accessible, structured site so that visitors can easily design their own business cards.

**Scope**

The site allows the user to choose out of three different sizes of business cards, to upload an own photo or logo, to choose a background color, to edit text content, to download the designed card as a pdf file, to choose the paper type, to choose the quantity, to send a request for a quotation for the designed business cards. On the landing page the above is explained and there is a possibility to request a sample kit for the paper types in case one is not familiar with the POSTFLY paper types.

**Structure**

This site is structured as clear as possible, it is easy to see what can be done on the page, on all screen sizes it is clear shouls be done on each part of the site. The design of the card is visible on all screen sizes. This all ensures that the user knows what to do and what to expect.
